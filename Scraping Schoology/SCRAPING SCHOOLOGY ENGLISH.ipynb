      "Review: I am writing this review as a High School Student for an academic project. I've haven been using this app for my Physics and English classes, among other subjects. It was simple adding other courses and viewing what the teacher had posted on some occasions. I was around 15 years old when I was using this app. For that age, I couldn't figure out what needed to be done and what assignments were due. I used Schoology on a laptop, so it was always in a web form. In the web form, I found it to be too cluttered to navigate the site. A lot of information was displayed simultaneously. While some assignments were in folders, the folders often didn't show in the list feature which displayed the assignments that were due. In addition, in some assignments teachers posted a picture, but the picture wouldn't be shown due to some errors in the system in Schoology. If these problems would be handled, it would make the website much easier to use. Thank you for your time, expecting greater things. Thank you.\n",

Also very disappointing that there are no options to upload files from my phone, or tablet - we're a tablet based school and this app is diabolical. I'm having to use OneNote.  Our school will be seriously reconsidering.  Also, your copy and paste response of \"please contact our support team\" is not customer care. App crashes like this have been reported to you numerous times in these feedback messages.\n",

It has most features,  but some are hard to access or don't work very often. For example, discussions that aren't in the regular updates section don't always work, and for me to be able to see my teachers' comments on my assignments also doesn't always work. Despite these flaws, I would say this is a very useful and functional app. I would recommend it.\n",

      "Review: This app is absolutely trash. Here's some more details, since you asked.  1 - This is not an app. It's a poor implementation of a web browser hooked to some cheap side-menu links that do not work.  2 - The user has to enter their user information and password over and over, because the app doesn't remember it, because as I mentioned in #1, it's not actually an app, it's a web browser.  3 - It is not even a good web browser wrapper, because the pages it redirects to are not designed for a phone, they're designed for a computer.  4 - When the links do occasionally work, the webpages that it brings up are either zoomed out so much they are unreadable, or zoomed in so much that tables are not displayed correctly, making it unusable.  5 - Many in-site links do not work either. I clicked on a \"read comments\" link, and the iframe that came up in the browser wanted my logon information. Again.  Please have your developer sit down with a good book on Android app development, and actually write an app. Considering how much my school district pays for Schoology, we deserve better than this.\n",

On iOS devices I see that feature, but no the Androids. Just make them equivalent and not make one more developed than the other. It's not that hard of a task if you did on iOS. I'm pretty most are just dying for this feature to happen. Please do this.\n",

      "Review: So I'm in Precalculus, and my school uses schoology. On schoology, my teacher has an \"Assignment List,\" which is a list of homework assignments and upcoming tests. One of the assignments is a worksheet, which when selected on the mobile browser gives the notification, \"This cannot be displayed.\" It then suggests downloading the schoology app in order to view it. However, after finding my class on the app, clicking on the assignment list simply takes me back to the page on chrome, where, after finding the worksheet again, it tells me that it can't be displayed, and that I should download the app in order to view it. 5 stars if you can do something about this, the app is much more convenient than going to the web page every time. This is just an issue I've had.\n",

If you close it on accident, which you will do because the back botton on you phone close it, it takes back to the main menu. The layout is not formatted properly, things are cutoff and squished awkwardly on screen. I only haven't deleted it because it keeps me from having one less Internet tab open.\n",
