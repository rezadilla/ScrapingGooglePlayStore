"March 3, 2020",1,I Got Jams 19,Why I can't log in?? It says that my device need to sync with your servers clock time/ timezone? My time is on time. Hope you can fix this.‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ
"February 20, 2020",2,Tech Priest,Why they decided that updating/ruining the UI was necessary is unknown to me but they've somehow made it even worse. It takes almost 30 seconds to load an assignment and then another 30 seconds to check your submission. There also no feature that allows you to download your submissions.

"December 17, 2019",1,Doreman203,"Tried to edit post to give it 0 stars..would not let me. Does not work. App keeps demanding I open a link in app and then the app says I need to download the app I am already using. And yes, it is up to date and yes I closed and reopened it and yes I logged out closed the app and reopened and relogged in and yes I did all of the above plus uninstalled it and rebooted my phone. Fix your app!"
"March 8, 2020",1,comrade lovic,"Unsusable format, needlessly complicated"
"February 5, 2020",4,Wolfy_gang _idk,Honestly this app is amazing and easy to use at school on our computers. But i cannot login on my phone. It tells me to put in my schools prfered email for me and i do i tried every single one i know even MY email but nothing happened. But that may be because i am on a phone so its diffrent.
"January 14, 2020",5,Marley Lang,"My school uses this app, and the user interface was easy to learn. Occasionally there is a WiFi glitch where it doesn't let you log in but usually this happens if you have a very busy connection. I would recommend this app!üòÅ"
"December 2, 2019",2,Scrophan Alcime,"It was working for a while but later it started to act up. While I was not using it, it would crash the app. In addition, it wouldn't load assignments."
"February 6, 2020",1,Bryant Hayman,I don't like this new update that schoolgy has! It crashes my phone whenever I try to open an assignment up for submission. It blacks out and then it finally opens up the assignment. Please fix this new update you have! Thanks!
"January 8, 2020",1,Christine Magto,
"January 23, 2020",1,Dana Cawthorne,This app was amazing but now all I get is a blank white screen ): and I cant get any help from the moderators.
"February 10, 2020",1,Mr.awesome awesome coolness,"Trying to access class documents, was told must download App to view docs, downloaded App, but receiving same message through App. Rather a waste of time."
"January 14, 2020",4,Kelly Tan,I like this app and I use it for school. Its really helpful but I strongly suggest that it can be just like the Apple version.
"February 8, 2020",1,Hossein Jafari,Bugs fix or generate? When click on groups to see doc app closed!!
"January 11, 2020",1,Jessica Ramos,I cant log in. I can only log in through website but not in this app.
"January 2, 2020",4,Rashdan Affandy Mohammed Kassim,Just installed the app to my samsung note FE andI think its a great app...but recently I could not view pdf files for example my son's school timetable....
"January 14, 2020",2,Bhavya Sai Kamasamudram,The folders of resources are not opening in the app to view the files and now I have to download them using laptop only
"December 6, 2019",2,Jack Mooren,Not the best it works for its Purpose but Seems to have minor bugs and faults
"April 25, 2020",3,Brian Valencia,"I am writing this review as a High School Student for an academic project. I've haven been using this app for my Physics and English classes, among other subjects. It was simple adding other courses and viewing what the teacher had posted on some occasions. I was around 15 years old when I was using this app. For that age, I couldn't figure out what needed to be done and what assignments were due. I used Schoology on a laptop, so it was always in a web form. In the web form, I found it to be too cluttered to navigate the site. A lot of information was displayed simultaneously. While some assignments were in folders, the folders often didn't show in the list feature which displayed the assignments that were due. In addition, in some assignments teachers posted a picture, but the picture wouldn't be shown due to some errors in the system in Schoology. If these problems would be handled, it would make the website much easier to use. Thank you for your time, expecting greater things. Thank you."
"January 22, 2020",4,alonso ornelas miranda,"Its an amazing app, the only one thing ill suggest is making it look like the apple version"
"January 12, 2020",5,crystal johnson,"Love this app, I have never had any issues"
"January 22, 2020",1,The Idiotic Genius,"Terrible. It showed the login page and when i logged in, then just showed a white screen! Then when I clicked the link on the bottom to try to log in that way it said ""Invalid."" I use a Samsung Galaxy S8. Please make your app comply with other electronic brands besides Apple and desktop."
"February 28, 2020",1,Treasure Classon,Doesn't let me sign in. Continuously tells me I put the wrong password in when I triple checked and it was the right one. Pls get this fixed.
"September 16, 2019",1,Jason Brinker,"It's essentially non-functional. Cannot navigate through courses, unable to download files. When you tap on a folder, the app navigates to the same folder you were already in. Useless. I have to try and use the full site on my phone in a browser, which is frustrating. This, by the way, is both a parent using it for his two school-age children, and an educator using it to teach students."
"October 15, 2018",2,A Google user,"Possibly the the most poorly organized and implemented application I've ever used on any device.. Most of the content is just their web site shoved into a frame, except things like links in posts don't work, and there is no way to navigate through content - the back button always exits the app. Trying to use messages crashes the application completely. Galaxy S8+"
"October 24, 2019",2,TheMLGTurtle,"This app is very good on iOS, but the app is literal garbage on Android. The layout is horrendous and everything is broken, I can't view some materials in some folders when I know there are materials in there. It just kicks me out of that folder. It's extremely annoying and they need to redo this app on Android and stop focusing too much on their app for iOS. This app is a waste of time trying to use it on Android, but if you have an iPhone or iPad, it works pretty well."
"February 2, 2019",1,Jordan Schoeppner,"This app is terrible!! No matter what I do, it always says my password is incorrect the first time. It makes me sign in twice before it recognizes me. When I use the app, the screen says ""it looks like you are using you phone to access schoology, try downloading the app!"" I AM ON THE APP!!! So I click on ""download app"" and it takes me to the play store and it says it's already downloaded. Terrible waste of time app."
"December 6, 2018",1,Jason Hutton,
"August 16, 2019",1,abrielle cabrera,"It worked great the first time i had to use it my sophomore year, but we have to change our password every semester and ever since the first change it wont let me long into the app, i can log into the website just fine but the app wont let me. Im starting my senior year now and it still wont let me log in, it tells me that my email or password is wrong even though i know i know its right because i log in on the website."
"January 25, 2019",3,Ethan Cox,"I am a student using this app. my conclusion after using this app for one semester is that, the functionality and learned curve is good. Its easy to use and fairly simple. However I found that the app design is very dated and clunky. If the app gets updated I believe it could be one of the best tools for a school to have."
"February 24, 2019",1,Mr.Panface,"Recently, my school has adopted Schoology as a method of taking stress off of both the students and the teachers. Now, you'd think a mobile app for such a service would be easily navigated and would be easier to use than the site, right? What you end up getting is a UI that looks and functions horribly. The best part: The app from the students view is much different than the parental view! The parental side of the app is much more concise and usable, unlike the student side. Just use the website"
"September 24, 2018",1,Yige Li,"Grade average not shown in app. The app is really slow and complicated. Everytime you try to submit a file for submission, you only can select one file each time, not allowing you to select multiple files in at once. The design also looks very outdated."
"October 4, 2019",1,Cory Williams,This app needs a lot of work. When I'm in the app dont tell me I need to download the app to open a pdf. Open the pdf in whatever tool opens the pdf on the phone. Navigation is a disaster. Expected back behavior doesnt work. Oh and when I get notifications I would expect it to open the app. It never does.
"September 3, 2019",3,Arika Miller,"Wish it had a more modern, easy feel. There's features you can access on the desktop version, like class roster, that the app version doesn't include. Make the grades page easier to navigate, too! It's 2019, please and thank you."
"April 13, 2019",2,Nick V,Very limited functionality. Does not do as much as the desktop site does. This may be problematic for people that do not always have access to a desktop computer like myself. What features are there work well though.
"August 30, 2019",1,Chip Sprague,Not mobile friendly at all. Does not rotate to read information provided by teachers must scroll each line left to right to read. Very difficult to navigate and not designed for parents. Must navigate multiple pages to get to your child's page. Not user friendly. I do hope they make major changes for parents.
"February 20, 2019",2,Stacey Rodriguez,The app is not very easy to use. There a lot of menus that don't go to where you think would go. One the app updated I thought it would be something that got fixed. I can't check because I got logged off and now can't log back in since I forgot my password. I look for a password recovery help and I don't find any.
"January 6, 2019",1,A Getsch,"Almost useless app. You can look at things but don't try to create/edit an assignment or submit work as a student. Go to a desktop computer or a laptop to do any real work. As a teacher, I wanted to grade and wasted hours grading things that did not get saved. I tell all my students to stop using the app."
"August 25, 2019",5,mer pez,"I must say that your app is very helpful, and I am very grateful to your team for that. If I may, for improvement, I would like to recommend that an option or setting be made available in the gradebook that could separate the male from the female students. This setting may require them to update their gender profiles. I'll look forward to this consideration. Thanks in advance."
"February 17, 2019",2,Beth Rogers,
"February 27, 2019",3,Chidera Anyamene,"Great, Love it this app is amazing and is very useful i got it on my phone to keep up with school work and it works great,keeping in contact with your class and school is a very good standard with this app.I just wish the password wasnt so hard to get intoüò§üòï"

"September 12, 2019",1,Kelley Taylor,
"September 6, 2019",1,S I,I have all my settings set up to send push and email notifications. I receive nothing! I constantly have to open the app to check instead of it working like it should be and send me notifications. I have checked all my phone settings and still doesnt work.
"February 25, 2019",1,A Google user,This app doesn't work I can't login to my student account and it keeps yelling me that there's an error every time and my friends can't figure out why its happening to me while it's working just fine for them.
"June 13, 2019",2,Nisarg Patel,I have had really bad experiences with the interface. It looks and feels outdated while the one on ios looks and operates way better. A lot of improvements need to be done in the ui and perfomance too. Please make the necessary changes.
"September 11, 2019",1,Lindsey Bergmann,Terrible app for Android. Nothing fits the screen. Hit the back button and you exit the app instead of going to the previous screen. Horrible to navigate. Worst part of my day is trying to navigate and scroll to find things on this app.
"December 10, 2018",1,Shravan Balaji,"For me I'll never forget how much trouble I had when submitting my assignments. Every time or almost every time when I submit, it gets deleted or never gets recieved by teacher. And to submit a document, it needs to be one file unfortunately. Thank god I'm a senior and that my time with schoology is almost over. Off for college!!!"
"October 3, 2018",1,Ally G,
"November 22, 2019",1,Shirley Joubert,It doesn't allow me to access hardly any of the information I need to see. Waste of time. Problem is I can't stop using it because my teachers keep uploading stuff to it.
"August 21, 2019",3,Pink kitten,I cannot get into my account on the app but on the website I can get in just fine. I type everything right and it says its incorrect. but for the 3 years I used it it was okay
"October 29, 2019",1,Andria Thompson,"Useless app!!!! I can't open any documents or login to the links for my kid's textbooks. Parent login is a joke! I can only view my kids Schoology page, unable to access any links. Both the app and the website are terrible when logged in as a parent!"
"September 10, 2019",1,Lillie Tokheim,I use schoology on my computer all the time so I know my login info. However the app refuses to let me login stating I have the wrong username or password. Very unfortunate since I needed to use the app for an assaignment.
"October 7, 2019",2,Angel Albus,This app is great. But it is hard to log out and religion. This is annoying to have to keep loving back in and then being told I am locked out. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
"August 19, 2019",3,XxWolfiexX,I like it but sometimes I wished it didn't existed because sometimes you gotta wait a long time to load and you use it a lot in school!!!!‚òπ‚òπ
"May 16, 2020",1,Rajeev Kumar,I trried to login so many time but it always show wrong username or password.so please help me
"September 30, 2019",4,Ronald Jinks,"This app is great. Only problem is, I can't send messages. It doesn't 'auto-populate' like it says in support. Most of my kids teachers need students to send them direct messages but she can't even do that."
"June 29, 2019",1,Tracey Law,"Frustrating! Resources folders never load when you want to look at the documents. Just keep getting the same page reappearing with the status ""loading"". Basically, I can't access anything that I would actually find useful!"
"September 20, 2019",1,Monica Nakagawa,"It used to work great, now every time I use it it says I can't do that until I install the app which is hilarious BECAUSE I'M USING THE APP. And I'm forced to use this garbage by my kid's school, so, awesome."
"October 10, 2019",2,Jacob DeHaven,"Navigation needs a lot of work! Also, the messaging feature does not pop up the keyboard anymore so can't type messages to teachers. Please fix"
"October 25, 2018",2,Candace Taylor,
"September 13, 2019",2,Bryan Boutz,Apparently this is just wrapping the website with an authentication layer and notifications. Pages are not even optimized for use on mobile devicesnand some content says to open the app which i am in.

"October 10, 2018",1,Chris B,Hate this program so very much. Impossibly complicated and lacking proper documentation or customer support.  Still can't do such essential tasks as.... adding a single grade!! Avoid!!

"March 18, 2019",4,idkwhattosay roblox,I love this app because you don't have to login again and again. There is a problem that it doesn't let you answer the discussion.
"November 11, 2019",5,Kamara Dorsey,Very Useful for me to keep up with all of my assignments also it is very useful for studnet to teacher assignment conversations. Also some times its a little slow but overall it is a great app to use.

"January 10, 2020",1,Anne Boggs,Horrible. This app really sucks yeah you get to see your child's grade but it doesn't tell you the work that they've done it just says it's subject and a grade. It would be better if we could see our child's work that has been graded instead of a subject. Do not recommend this app do not install do not waste your time

Our school will be seriously reconsidering.  Also, your copy and paste response of ""please contact our support team"" is not customer care. App crashes like this have been reported to you numerous times in these feedback messages."

"December 8, 2017",1,Rob Riker,"Attachments don't show in app (ironically, error msg says to download app). Defies Android UI conventions - you can be many layers down and if you hit the back button once it dumps you out of the app & makes you start again. Several ways to navigate, except most don't work, so you have to know which controls to ignore. (S6edge & Note 12.2 Pro)"
"November 30, 2017",1,Mommy3Ari,"When all the features work, it is great. My interactive lectures have not loaded for 2 months. Official Tech inquiries have been made and still no improvement. This eliminates an entire study block where I'm using my phone out in public. It puts me behind and is very disappointing."
"December 7, 2017",1,Imposter,I can't even log into my account. It always says email and password incorrect but I entered it very slowly and same thing. Also did it on my pc and it worked so I know its the app.
"December 5, 2017",3,Elizabeth McKeown,"The app is kind of a mess. Navigation is convoluted and it might be the least intuitive interface of all time. That being said, it's the best way to keep up with my kids' assignments and it has a great deal of potential."
"December 6, 2017",1,Dave Cobb,"Android notifications don't do anything if you click them, it should take you to the appropriate message in the app.... please fix.  I just gave you the problem information... please take it from here and fix it."

"November 9, 2017",4,A Google user,"The Schoology app is very useful for me to easily pull up my home updates dashboard on my phone when I don't have access to a computer or even just on the fly. It has most features,  but some are hard to access or don't work very often. For example, discussions that aren't in the regular updates section don't always work, and for me to be able to see my teachers' comments on my assignments also doesn't always work. Despite these flaws, I would say this is a very useful and functional app. I would recommend it."
"November 11, 2017",1,A Google user,"The app does not load most important things like the syllabus, lecture material, and etc.  Concept is great, but what it delivers is very poor. I wish there was a different app to use.  I can say that this app is much better on the iPhone.  Please fix!!!"
"November 11, 2017",1,Katherine,The app is terrible. Can't even select multiple files to send to my teacher. It keeps changing the file that was uploaded and it logs me out every time it updates. It also crashes everytime I check my grades!!!

"September 20, 2017",5,P Qin,"online allows id as login.  app only uses email address.  however, online registration does not have option to enter email address since created user id.  poor design  Update: developer quickly reached out to me.  the login issue was resolved after I used a different option.  However, the login page could be re-worded so that people clearly understand that in order to use user name, you will have to enter school name.  app itself is easy to use."
"September 27, 2017",1,Erin McCann,"Horrible, but at least better than the website. As a 33 year IT professional I feel this app has about 32 planners, 2 coders and no UI designers. Probably a great Sales department, though, considering how many schools they conned into this garbage. This app is a prime example of incompetence in both education and corporate software. Microsoft could not have screwed this up more circa Windows ME."
"September 23, 2017",1,lovetigersnake11 stuffedanimalgirl15@hotmail.com,Never in my life have I seen such incompetence from such an app. Never before have I want to shoot myself in the foot as much as I want to now... This is the most dysfunctional app I've ever seen and the worst part is I think that they could have done better because some features actually work while others are just totally dysfunctional and do not work at all. Actually nevermind that's not true none of them work. I actually only use the app for about 5 minutes so I have no idea what I'm saying I just actually hate my school so yeah.
"September 14, 2017",4,Ford Family,There are times where the app just stops working so I have to use my computer or search it up on my browser. But other than that it's a great app that I LOVE to use
"October 7, 2017",4,Matt Lyons,Great LMS! Easy to use for my kids in class and my homebound students. App is fairly reliable and easy to use though not ALL functions are there. Not a problem 99.9% of the time though.
"October 1, 2017",1,Ben Romer,"This app is absolutely trash. Here's some more details, since you asked.  1 - This is not an app. It's a poor implementation of a web browser hooked to some cheap side-menu links that do not work.  2 - The user has to enter their user information and password over and over, because the app doesn't remember it, because as I mentioned in #1, it's not actually an app, it's a web browser.  3 - It is not even a good web browser wrapper, because the pages it redirects to are not designed for a phone, they're designed for a computer.  4 - When the links do occasionally work, the webpages that it brings up are either zoomed out so much they are unreadable, or zoomed in so much that tables are not displayed correctly, making it unusable.  5 - Many in-site links do not work either. I clicked on a ""read comments"" link, and the iframe that came up in the browser wanted my logon information. Again.  Please have your developer sit down with a good book on Android app development, and actually write an app. Considering how much my school district pays for Schoology, we deserve better than this."
"October 4, 2017",3,LIVE & LEARN,"THERE'S no CHAT ROOM in your software..!!! Because I am doing remote online training.   BACKCHANNEL CHAT DOESN'T WORK ALL THE TIME.. PLEASE ADD CHAT ROOM TO SCHOOLOGY. THANKS  Latest Problem I found..  #### When I embed a video in Schoology, in the HTML I have allowed FULL SCREEN MODE.. On my android phone. I hit the full screen icon on the video. It just gave me a black screen.. IT should show the video in LANDSCAPE FULL SCREEN MODE .. Please advise what i need to do to make this work..  Thanks...  #####. GROUPs Should also PROVIDE similar features  LIKE THE COURSE MODULE.. AUDIO RECORDING FEATURE IS NEEDED TO MAKE IT A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND FUN WAY OF INTERACTING.. @@@@ SEE FEATURES IN SEESAW CLASS SOFTWARE@@@@  First of all, the system technically is quite good.. EXCEPT for the following:   1. BLUE SYSTEM Color is VERY DULL AND BORING.  2. Is there a way to list all the courses on A single page so students can choose which one they wish to join?  I am setting up workshops instead of standard classes..  4. Discussion items need to have its own picture displayed alongside the title.. This will make it much more interesting for the students to ENGAGE..  Best Regards, Simon"
"September 24, 2017",3,Diemas,Still needs a lot of improvement like the system after doing a task sometime the outcome (the score) is different eventhough we already doing it with right Also it still has many bug and crash this is really iritating
"October 4, 2017",2,A Miller,"wasted a day of setup on this. signed consent form, but was then rejected approval with no explanation.  can't add a member to a class.  schoology doesn't recognize the school.  no contact for help/support.  no-reply notification with no explanation at all."

Please fix."

"May 28, 2017",4,Roawoon Lee,"This app is all around good, but the thing that sets this apart from being a 5 star app is the fact that it doesn't show the averages of the classes. On iOS devices I see that feature, but no the Androids. Just make them equivalent and not make one more developed than the other. It's not that hard of a task if you did on iOS. I'm pretty most are just dying for this feature to happen. Please do this."

"May 6, 2017",4,Owl,"So I'm in Precalculus, and my school uses schoology. On schoology, my teacher has an ""Assignment List,"" which is a list of homework assignments and upcoming tests. One of the assignments is a worksheet, which when selected on the mobile browser gives the notification, ""This cannot be displayed."" It then suggests downloading the schoology app in order to view it. However, after finding my class on the app, clicking on the assignment list simply takes me back to the page on chrome, where, after finding the worksheet again, it tells me that it can't be displayed, and that I should download the app in order to view it. 5 stars if you can do something about this, the app is much more convenient than going to the web page every time. This is just an issue I've had."
"May 3, 2017",3,Jim W,The forum is not organized at all.  The grades just show a * until you drill down into it.  The discussion notifications do not tale you to the reply.  It works for viewing lectures but two stars for that basic functionality not working.
"April 21, 2017",2,Tranquilityy.t,I really don't like the fact that when people send u links for work u cant view them on the phone. the whole point you download it is bc ur on the go and cant be on a computer. U GUYS NEED AN UPDATE.

If you close it on accident, which you will do because the back botton on you phone close it, it takes back to the main menu. The layout is not formatted properly, things are cutoff and squished awkwardly on screen. I only haven't deleted it because it keeps me from having one less Internet tab open."

"January 20, 2017",4,A Google user,"I like that I can grade my students' work from my phone while riding the bus! One thing that would be nice would be if the text of students' submissions were visible on the page where I grade the submission, maybe under an arrow. It's annoying to open a file on a separate page for every single submission, especial the ones that the kids typed in the ""Create"" box."
"January 20, 2017",3,Ethan Garvey,"Not very polished. My friend used the app to log into his account and now, even though I logged out of his and back into mine, I'm getting notifications from his teachers' postings. Bugs with taking tests are an issue that should be solved. One wrong on a matching section makes you lose points for that whole problem... Not the best companion for school."
